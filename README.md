Project analysis, Information architecture: describe using around200 words (minimum) how you have distributed the information of the page:

To structure the information on my website, I used my existing curriculum as a basis and organized it into sections that clearly showcase my background, experience, and skills.  
The first section, “About Me,” serves as an introduction, where I provide a personal overview. This section includes details about who I am, my hobbies, and what drives me professionally. I believe it’s important for visitors to get a sense of my personality and interests from the start. 
The second section, “Professional Experience,” highlights my work history. Here, I describe my past roles. This section is designed to give potential employers or collaborators a clear idea of what I can contribute based on my practical experience. 
The “Education” section follows, where I outline my academic background. I include details on my degree and any special projects. I believe that showcasing both my formal education and hands-on experience provides a comprehensive view of my qualifications. 
The “Skills” section presents my technical abilities and language proficiencies. In this section, I specify programming languages I am comfortable with and my proficiency in other languages, which adds to my versatility as a professional. 
Finally, the “Contact Me” section provides easy access to my social media profiles and contact details, making it simple for anyone to reach out. This structured layout ensures a logical flow, allowing visitors to gain a well-rounded view of my background and qualifications. 

 


 

 Project analysis, Visual design: describe using around 200 words(minimum) the main decisions you have made for the visual design:

For the visual design of my website, I aimed to keep the layout straightforward and easy to navigate, even though the site is not fully responsive. The color scheme is based on a dark background (#1D1D1D) with accents in warm yellow-orange (#D99441), which provides a strong contrast and helps emphasize different elements. To visually separate sections, I alternated the title designs: odd-numbered sections have yellow text on a dark background, while even-numbered sections reverse this with a yellow background and dark text. This approach adds visual interest and guides the user’s eye through the page. 

The font Josefin Sans was chosen for its clean and modern look, enhancing readability across sections. Text sizes vary to create a hierarchy—section titles are large and bold, while body text is slightly smaller for easier reading. I used fixed headers to make navigation more intuitive, allowing users to quickly jump between sections without losing their place. 

In the Skills section, I used JavaScript to add functionality that makes skill bars dynamic, visually filling up to represent each skill level when the section is viewed. This interactive detail highlights each skill level in a way that’s easy to understand at a glance. Each design choice was made to keep the page simple, visually cohesive, and easy to read, ensuring that the main information is clearly accessible.
